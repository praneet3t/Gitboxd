# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 2024

## Overview

GitBoxd is a client-side web application that processes your Letterboxd export data entirely in your browser. We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## Data Processing

### Client-Only Mode (Default)

- **All data processing happens locally in your browser**
- Your Letterboxd ZIP file is never uploaded to any server
- Parsed data is stored only in your browser's memory during your session
- No data is transmitted over the network
- No cookies or tracking scripts are used
- No analytics or telemetry is collected

### What We Don't Collect

- Personal information
- Letterboxd credentials
- Watch history or ratings
- IP addresses
- Browser fingerprints
- Usage analytics

## Data Storage

- No data is stored on our servers (because we don't have servers in client-only mode)
- Your browser may cache the application code for faster loading
- You can clear your browser cache at any time

## Third-Party Services

In client-only mode, GitBoxd does not use any third-party services or APIs.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- You choose what to upload
- You can export your processed data as JSON
- You can close the browser tab to immediately clear all data from memory

## Future Features

If we add optional server-side features (e.g., shareable profiles), we will:
- Require explicit opt-in consent
- Update this privacy policy
- Provide a data deletion mechanism
- Clearly indicate what data is stored and for how long

## Contact

For privacy concerns or questions, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Changes to This Policy

We will notify users of any material changes to this privacy policy by updating the "Last Updated" date.

**Your privacy is our priority. GitBoxd is built privacy-first.**
